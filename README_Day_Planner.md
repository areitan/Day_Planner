# Day_Planner



## Description

Given a ```.gif``` file of a day planner and a beginning HTML and CSS file, the goal is to create a day planner that resembles the one in the ```.gif``` file. It should have the current day displayed at the top of the calendar with timeblocks for standard business hours. The timeblocks should be color-coded to represent past, present, and future. A user should be able to enter events into the timeblocks and save to local storage so they are still there after page refresh.
